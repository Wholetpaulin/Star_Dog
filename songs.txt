Boots on pavement, haustling hard
Peddling the streets, a modern bard
Dropping ones in my tip jar
Contribute half to my vanguard

No more day job, break the chain
Baby boomers pass the blame
Bitter breath teeth coffee stained
Caffinnee pumping in my veins

Making my way in the shade
Making my way in the shade
Hiding from the sunny day
Making my way in the shade

Can't predict what's gonna change
Millenial values very strange
They don't want marradge, arranged
They don't wear co-por-ate chains

Cell phone beeping, can't think straight
News reporting all the hate
Don't trust news, don't trust the state
Don't just fall for the JaBait

10 Things

Music. It's the only thing that matters
The hangover turnarounds got me feeling less shattered
Today's vulgarity makes me second guess myself
Hope this song becomes a trophy, put it all up on the shelf

In any case, I'd like to advise my past self
I hope you'll find it useful, hope it helps somebody else
These are 10 things that popped into my mind
Things I would tell past Paul, could I go back in time

Be patient, You'll catch p soon enough
just give yourself some time, and keep on showing up

Stop comparing yourself to others. It's killing creativity
It's killing your rhymes. Steal back some self liberty

Be happy. Have fun even on the days it's hard
Sign the positive songs, leave out the sad parts

Take care of yourself especially your helath
Not only nutritional, but mental as well

Stretch your legs out son, exercise a bit
If you want to live long without heart attacks and shit

Easy choices, hard life.  Hard choices, easy life
Get this down now, save yourself some strife

Be kind be honest and leave pride behind
He's a waste of your energy and a waste of time

Don't dwell on the past learn from mistakes& move on
They say the day is always darkest before teh dawn

So don't ever give up, don't ever give in
Hold out until the light starts shining again
